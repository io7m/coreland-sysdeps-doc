    Approach to portability
      Be general, then be specific where required
        "sysctl unless platform has something better or doesn't have it at all"
    Requirements for calling a platform "supported"
      Full 8-task parallel make with no internal warnings or errors.
      Full 8-task parallel make clean-all with no internal warnings or errors.
      Detection of as many properties as the given platform allows.
      Correct detection of system features in as many modules as possible.
